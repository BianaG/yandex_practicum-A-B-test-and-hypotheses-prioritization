# yandex_practicum-A-B-test-and-hypotheses-prioritization
In this project, we will analyze the data of a big online store. The store wants to boost its revenues, so the marketing department compiled some hypotheses that may help accomplish this objective. The main goal of this project is to prioritize the hypotheses and analyze the results of the A/B test.
